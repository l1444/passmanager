# passmanager

A simple and fast password manager made in Rust and in CLI application.

Using the password manager

Being on a linux distribution, I will show you how to do it on a linux distribution .. LOGIC !!
In short if you don't have the Rust compiler:
```shell
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```
So thereafter, logically on linux distributions git is installed as a base in order to clone the packets in the packet manager, but in short!
So you download the project by doing:
```shell
git clone https://github.com/L1444/passmanager
```
to go to the project workspace:
```shell
cd passmanager/
```
and you do:
```shell
cargo install --path .
```
And it's good!! You can start the software by typing in the command line :
```shell
passmanager
```
and for get help for this software : 
```shell
passmanager --help
```

And it's good!! You can start the software by typing in the command line "passmanager", everything will be stored in a configuration folder !!
Normally on MacOS, it should work and on windows to see because the cross-platform compilation looks good!
In any case, the project is going to be more and more improving even if it is a small script just for a manager!

*Say good bye!*
